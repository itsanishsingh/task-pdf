The Lament 7
how he suffered, what he said before he died, how he died.
One must describe every detail of the funeral, and the
journey to the hospital to fetch the dead son’s clothes. His
daughter, Anissia, has remained in the village—one must
talk about her too. It is nothing he has to tell? Surely the
listener would gasp and sigh, and sympathise with him? It
is better, too, to talk to women; two words are enough to
make them sob.
‘I’ll go and look after my horse,’ thinks Iona; ‘there’s
always time to sleep. No fear of that!’
He puts on his coat and goes to the stable to his horse;
he thinks of the corn, the hay, the weather. When he is
alone, he dare not think of his son; he can speak about
him to anyone, but to think of him, and picture him to
himself, is unbearably painful.
‘Are you tucking in?’ Iona asks his horse, looking at its
bright eyes: ‘go on, tuck in, though we’ve not earned our
corn, we can eat hay. Yes I am too old to drive—my son
could have, not I. He was a first-rate cabdriver. If only he
had lived!’
Iona is silent for a moment, then continues:
‘That’s how it is, my old horse. There’s no more Kuzma
Ionitch. He has left us to live, and he went off pop. Now
let’s say you had a foal, you were the foal’s mother and,
suddenly, let’s say, that foal went and left you to live after
him. It would be sad, wouldn’t it?’
The little horse munches, listens and breathes over
its master’s hand…
Iona’s feelings are too much for him and he tells the
little horse the whole story.
