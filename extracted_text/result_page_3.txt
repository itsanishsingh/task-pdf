The Lament 3
With a nod of assent Iona picks up the reins, in
consequence of which layers of snow slip off the horse’s
back and neck. The officer seats himself in the sleigh, the
cabdriver smacks his lips to encourage his horse, stretches
out his neck like a swan, sits up and, more from habit
than necessity, brandishes his whip. The little horse also
stretches its neck, bends its wooden-looking legs, and
makes a move undecidedly.
‘What are you doing, werewolf!’ is the exclamation Iona
hears from the dark mass moving to and fro, as soon as
they have started.
‘Where the devil are you going? To the r-r-right!’
‘You do not know how to drive. Keep to the right!’ calls
the officer angrily.
A coachman from a private carriage swears at him; a
passerby, who has run across the road and rubbed his
shoulder against the horse’s nose, looks at him furiously
as he sweeps the snow from his sleeve. Iona shifts about
on his seat as if he were on needles, moves his elbows as if
he were trying to keep his equilibrium, and gasps about
like someone suffocating, who does not understand why
and wherefore he is there.
‘What scoundrels they all are!’ jokes the officer; ‘one
would think they had all entered into an agreement to jostle
you or fall under your horse.’
Iona looks around at the officer and moves his lips. He
evidently wants to say something but the only sound that
issues is a snuffle.
‘What?’ asks the officer.
Iona twists his mouth into a smile and, with an effort,
says hoarsely:
‘My son, Barin, died this week.’
‘Hm! What did he die of?’
Iona turns with his whole body towards his fare and
says: ‘And who knows! They say high fever. He was three
days in the hospital and then died… God’s will be done.’
“Turn round! The devil!’ sounds from the darkness.
‘Have you popped off, old doggie, eh? Use your eyes!’
‘Go on, go on,’ says the officer, ‘otherwise we shall not
get there by tomorrow. Hurry up a bit!’
