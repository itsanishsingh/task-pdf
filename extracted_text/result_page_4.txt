4 Woven Words
The cabdriver again stretches his neck, sits up and,
with a bad grace, brandishes his whip. Several times again
he turns to look at his fare, but the latter has closed his
eyes and, apparently, is not disposed to listen. Having
deposited the officer in the Viborg, he stops by the tavern,
doubles himself up on his seat, and again remains
motionless, while the snow once more begins to cover him
and his horse. An hour, and another… Then, along the
footpath, with a squeak of galoshes, and quarrelling, come
three young men, two of them tall and lanky, the third one
short and humpbacked.
‘Cabby, to the Police Bridge!’ in a cracked voice calls
the humpback. ‘The three of us for two griveniks .’
Iona picks up his reins and smacks his lips. Two

‘Now you, ‘such a’, hurry up, are you going the whole
