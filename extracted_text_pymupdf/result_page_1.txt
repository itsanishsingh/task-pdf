as if he were on needles
It is twilight. A thick wet snow is slowly twirling around
the newly lighted street lamps and lying in soft thin layers
on roofs, on horses’ backs, on people’s shoulders and hats.
The cabdriver, Iona Potapov, is quite white and looks like a
phantom: he is bent double as far as a human body can
bend double; he is seated on his box; he never makes a
move. If a whole snowdrift fell on him, it seems as if he
would not find it necessary to shake it off. His little horse
is also quite white, and remains motionless; its immobility,
its angularity and its straight wooden-looking legs, even
close by, give it the appearance of a gingerbread horse
worth a kopek. It is, no doubt, plunged in deep thought. If
you were snatched from the plough, from your usual gray
surroundings, and were thrown into this slough full of
monstrous lights, unceasing noise and hurrying people,
you too would find it difficult not to think.
Iona and his little horse have not moved from their
place for a long while. They left their yard before dinner
and, up to now, not a fare. The evening mist is descending
over the town, the white lights of the lamps are replacing
brighter rays, and the hubbub of the street is getting louder.
‘Cabby for Viborg Way!’ suddenly hears Iona. ‘Cabby!’
Iona jumps and, through his snow-covered eyelashes,
sees an officer in a greatcoat, with his hood over his head.
‘Viborg way!’ the officer repeats. ‘Are you asleep, eh?
Viborg way!’
