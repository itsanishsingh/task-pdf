Woven Words
without noticing him or his trouble. Yet it is such an
immense, illimitable, grief. Should his heart break and the
grief pour out, it would flow over the whole earth, so it
seems, and yet no one sees it. It has managed to conceal
itself in such an insignificant shell that no one can see it
even by day and with a light.
Iona sees a hall porter with some sacking and decides
to talk to him.
‘Friend, what sort of time is it?’ he asks.
‘Past nine. What are you standing here for? Move on.’
Iona moves on a few steps, doubles himself up, and
abandons himself to his grief. He sees it is useless to turn
